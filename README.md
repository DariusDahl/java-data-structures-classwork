# Java Data Structures Classwork

This repository contains a collection of projects from my data structures coursework, focusing on fundamental concepts and their practical implementation in Java. Each folder represents a self-contained module exploring different data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

### Purpose
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Hands-on implementation of core data structures.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
- Modular design using interfaces and classes.
- Application of data structure operations to solve computational problems.

### Topics Covered
- Stack (Array-based)
- Binary Tree
- Recursive Algorithms
- Simple Linked List
- Array Bounded Queue
- ArrayList vs LinkedList Benchmark
- Other data structures as the coursework progresses.

## Current Projects

### 1. [Array Stack](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/array-stack/)
- **Overview**: A simple stack implementation using arrays. This project demonstrates how to efficiently manage data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand stack operations like push, pop, and top.
  - Implement fixed-capacity constraints in stacking with array manipulations.
  - Use validation methods (`isEmpty`, `isFull`) to handle edge cases.

### 2. [Binary Tree](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/binary-tree/)
- **Overview**: A hierarchical binary tree structure implemented in Java. This project showcases recursive algorithms for traversals, summation, and search functionality.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Explore traversal methods: Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order.
  - Implement recursive algorithms for search and summation.
  - Apply sorting techniques on ArrayList data to enhance understanding.

### 3. [Recursive Algorithms](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/recursive-algorithms/)
- **Overview**: A collection of recursive solutions for common computational problems. Projects include Fibonacci number calculation, subset generation, recursive array summation, and filtering subsets divisible by 3 or 5.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Design and analyze recursive solutions with rigorous base cases.
  - Apply recursion to mathematical, combinatorial, and filtering applications.
  - Optimize recursive approaches for computational efficiency.

### 4. [Simple Linked List](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/linked-list/implementation/)
- **Overview**: A generic implementation of a singly linked list. This project demonstrates dynamic data manipulation with operations for inserting, deleting, and accessing nodes at specific positions.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand dynamic memory management via node-based structures.
  - Implement pointer manipulation to create and manage linked nodes.
  - Leverage Java generics for flexible data type support.

### 5. [ArrayList vs LinkedList Benchmark](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/linked-list/arraylist-vs-linkedlist-benchmark/)
- **Overview**: A performance benchmark comparing random access and swapping operations between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. Demonstrates scalability and trade-offs between direct indexing (`ArrayList`) and sequential traversal (`LinkedList`).
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Measure and compare the execution time for random access and swap operations.
  - Highlight time complexity differences as input sizes scale (`N` values).
  - Explore the impact of data structure design on performance for large datasets.

### 6. [Array Bounded Queue](https://github.com/DariusDahl/data-structures-classwork-java/blob/main/array-bounded-queue/)
- **Overview**: A fixed-capacity FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue implemented using arrays. This project emphasizes exception handling, circular array manipulation, and queue management techniques.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Efficiently handle data with queue operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`) and validation checks (`isEmpty`, `isFull`).
  - Implement exception handling for overflow and underflow conditions.
  - Explore dynamic memory management with circular arrays.
