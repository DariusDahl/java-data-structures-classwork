# Java Data Structures Classwork

This repository contains a collection of projects from my data structures coursework, focusing on fundamental concepts and their practical implementation in Java. Each folder represents a self-contained module exploring different data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

### Purpose
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Hands-on implementation of core data structures.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
- Modular design using interfaces and classes.
- Application of data structure operations to solve computational problems.

### Topics Covered
- Stack (Array-based)
- Binary Tree
- Other data structures as the coursework progresses.

## Current Projects

### 1. [Array Stack](https://github.com/DariusDahl/java-data-structures-classwork/blob/main/array-stack/)
- **Overview**: A simple stack implementation using arrays. This project demonstrates how to efficiently manage data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand stack operations like push, pop, and top.
  - Implement fixed-capacity constraints in stacking with array manipulations.
  - Use validation methods (`isEmpty`, `isFull`) to handle edge cases.

### 2. [Binary Tree](https://github.com/DariusDahl/java-data-structures-classwork/blob/main/binary-tree/)
- **Overview**: A hierarchical binary tree structure implemented in Java. This project showcases recursive algorithms for traversals, summation, and search functionality.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Explore traversal methods: Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order.
  - Implement recursive algorithms for search and summation.
  - Apply sorting techniques on ArrayList data to enhance understanding.

This repository will grow as I continue to explore more data structures and their functionalities.
